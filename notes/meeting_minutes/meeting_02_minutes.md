## **Summary**

### **Review of Previous Session**

*We had agreed that after the meeting, we would revisit Ian’s last session to
 refine our approach to framing research questions*.

### **Research Topics**

*We had selected two primary topics(questions) suggested in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1osuKb5Kt4wrI_lXdwCB6yPd4AjXrTgAE/edit?slide=id.p2&pli=1#slide=id.p2)
 for further exploration*:

- Why is flooding a critical issue in South Sudan and how can data science help
 in predicting, monitoring, and potentially reducing  the impact of the floods
- The impact of AI on climate change

*These topics remained open for debate. If members had alternative suggestions
 with better data availability, they would share them with the group*.

### **Scope and Originality**

*We emphasized narrowing the scope to develop a specific, original research
 question that hadn’t been extensively studied*.

### **Next Steps**

***Data collection***: *Everyone would search for relevant data on the two
 topics and share findings on Slack by 2 PM EST the next day*.  

***Progress Review***:  
*We would discuss the compiled data and prepare for June 10th's presentation meeting*.

### **Presentation**

*Rama would create slides summarizing our progress on the milestone, and Hiba
 would present them on that day's meeting*.

### **Flexibility**

*We acknowledged that the research focus may evolve as new insights emerge*.
