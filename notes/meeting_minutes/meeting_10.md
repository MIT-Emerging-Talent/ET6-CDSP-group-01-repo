**📜 Meeting Agenda**: Discussing Data Analysis Strategy
**👥 Attendees:** 4

## 📋 Summary

- Team sets deadline for data analysis process for better handling of the deliverables
- Team needs to agree on single analysis that allows result replication
- Analysis should be descriptive, focusing on identifying trends
- Suggesting that everyone share their current work on Slack for further review
  and potential integration
- Discussion on how to consider synthetic data and how it could answer
  our research question
- Task allocation

### 📑 Challenges

- Comparative city analysis required coordination between diverse datasets and
  localized flood histories
- The original dataset only covered 5 years, which was insufficient for
  meaningful trend analysis. Therefore, Hiba had to dedicate significant effort
to generate synthetic data to extend the dataset to 20 years—highlighting the
dependency on artificial data due to real-world data scarcity.

### 🚀 Next steps

- Next steps include analyzing synthetic data and identifying trends
- Working on the allocated tasks in the deliverables
