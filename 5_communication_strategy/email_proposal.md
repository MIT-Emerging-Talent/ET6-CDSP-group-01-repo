# E-mail Draft Proposal

**Subject:** Proposal for Collaboration on Urbanization and Flood Risk Research
 in Nile Basin Cities

**From:** Curious Minds Team, MIT Emerging Talent Program, <curiousmindsgroup1@gmail.com>

**To:** Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), <info@igad.int>

Dear IGAD Team,

We are a group of aspiring data scientists from the **MIT Emerging Talent Program**,
 working under the team name **Curious Minds,** group 1, and this is our [repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-01-repo).
  We are reaching out to
  share our  recent research and propose a potential collaboration with IGAD,
   given your mission to foster regional cooperation and resilience in the face
    of climate challenges.

## Why This Project Matters to IGAD’s Mission

Floods in rapidly growing cities within the Nile Basin such as **Kampala** and
 **Addis Ababa**, are becoming more frequent and severe. Our study investigated
  how **urban expansion interacts with rainfall variability** to influence flood
   risks. These findings directly align with IGAD’s work in climate change
    adaptation, disaster resilience, and sustainable urban development, as they
     highlight critical vulnerabilities in cities that are economic and
      population hubs of the region.

### Research Highlights

* When studying both cities together, we found that **urban growth and flood
 severity are closely linked**.
* Separately, however, results showed that **flooding sometimes decreased with
 city expansion**, suggesting that **drainage systems and infrastructure planning**
 play a critical role.
* Years of rapid, unchecked expansion coincided with **worse flood events**,
 likely due to insufficient adaptation of drainage systems.
* **Kampala showed more severe floods** compared to Addis Ababa, which could be
 influenced by its topography (built on \~27 hills).

Our results emphasize that:

* Urbanization does not always worsen floods, but **unchecked growth does**.
* **City-specific analysis** is necessary before drawing regional conclusions.

### Data Needs and Challenges

Despite progress, we faced **significant data gaps** in:

* Land use & topography
* Infrastructure & drainage systems
* Population exposure metrics

To address this, we sometimes used **synthetic data**, but this introduces
 uncertainties. Access to **more granular and locally verified datasets** would
 greatly improve the reliability of results.

### Potential Collaboration or Support

We believe IGAD could support and collaborate with us through:

* **Facilitating access to real-world data** on floods, urban growth, and
 population exposure in the Nile Basin.
* **Connecting us with domain experts and member-state agencies** working on
 urban planning, water management, and climate resilience.
* Exploring opportunities to **co-develop predictive models** that inform policy
 and infrastructure planning in rapidly growing cities.

### Expected Outcomes

Through collaboration with IGAD, we aim to:

* Strengthen **data-driven understanding of urbanization’s impact on flooding**.
* Support **evidence-based policy recommendations** for sustainable urban growth.
* Contribute to IGAD’s broader mission of **climate resilience and disaster
 preparedness** in the region.

We have attached supporting **infographics** summarizing our results for clarity.
 Our full research paper and GitHub repository are also available upon request.

We would be honored to discuss this further and explore ways in which our work
 could align with IGAD’s ongoing initiatives.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
