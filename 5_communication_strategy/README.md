# Communication Strategy

## Audience Description

- Our main target audience is researchers and academics who study urban studies,
 environmental science, hydrology, geography, and development policy, especially
  those who focus on Uganda and Ethiopia.
- The secondary target audience we would like to reach is Intergovernmental
 Authority on Development([IGAD](https://igad.int/)).

## Researchers

### Research Personas

[Assoc. Prof. Frank Mugagga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-mugagga-35b95964/):

- Experienced Lecturer with a demonstrated history of working in the higher
 education industry. Skilled in Research Design, Academic Writing, Management,
  Geoinformatics, and University Teaching. Strong education professional with a
   Doctor of Philosophy - PhD focused in Environmental Geography from Nelson
    Mandela Metropolitan University.

[Dr. Admasu Tsegaye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/admasu-tsegaye-a51551241/?originalSubdomain=et):

- Professor Admasu Tsegaye is a highly experienced, well-rounded, visionary,
 result-oriented, and committed professional and leader with great leadership,
 management, teamwork, research, consultancy, and diplomacy skills. He teaches
 courses to undergraduate and postgraduate students, supervises several PhD and
 MSc students, and serves as a PhD and MSc examiner in Ethiopian universities
 and abroad in areas of production ecology, agricultural sciences, and natural
 resource management. He has also undertaken research, consulting, and capacity
 building on sustainable agriculture, food security, natural resources, and
 biodiversity management. He has authored or co-authored over 50 journal
 articles in a wide range of distinguished international journals and has
 written a book, research manuals, and book chapters. In addition to his duties
 as a teacher and researcher over the past 25 years, he has held a variety of
 academic positions at the universities in Hawassa and Addis Ababa. These
 included the presidents of Addis Ababa and Hawassa Universities, as well as
 vice presidents for academic affairs, administration, and development at
 Hawassa University. He headed the reform initiatives that have helped
 transform the two universities into the top research universities in Africa.
 He held a number of positions in higher education and research abroad. The
 Director of the Consortium of African US-Educators, the Global Vice President
 of Sun Moon University in South Korea, the Country Representative of Plant
 Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA), the Project Leader, and the Country
 Representative of Co-Innovation for Quality in the Agri-Food Chain in Africa.
 In addition to the prestigious USA Fulbright African Research Scholar Award at
 Oklahoma State University for the 2011–2012 academic years, he has also
 received the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Regional State's
 Excellence and Distinguished Leadership Award and the African Higher Education
 Leadership Award. He founded the Center for Sustainable Agriculture and
 Environment and serves as its senior advisor. He was designated Ambassador of
 Ethiopia to Indonesia and accredited to Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia,
 Pakistan, the Maldives, and ASEAN. He brought to his ambassadorial assignment
 important knowledge and experiences accumulated from a successful career in
 academia and research. He is the chair and member of several governing boards
 in Ethiopia and has played a key role in the success of the organizations.

### Capabilities

- Open to collaborations and comparative urban studies
- Regularly engage with peer-reviewed research
- Strong interest in practical case studies relevant to the local or regional context
- Strong technical and analytical skills
- Access to modeling tools and statistical methods
- Experience working with satellite data, spatial analysis, and time-series trends
- Familiarity with open-source platforms and reproducible research

### Constraints

- Time constraints due to teaching and administrative responsibilities
- Limited inter-institutional collaboration or data sharing, especially across
 African contexts
- Funding or time limitations to explore under-documented regions

### How we intend to Reach Them

- Academic Publications: Target regional journals

- **GitHub Repository**: All datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and documentation are
 available under an open, structured repo. We'll tag and summarize key findings
 to enhance discoverability.
- **Research-Oriented Policy Brief**: A short, digestible summary of our
 methodology, key findings, data limitations, and a call to action to encourage
 reuse and collaboration.

### What We Want Them to Learn  

- Open-source tools and datasets like CHIRPS rainfall can enable cost-effective
 local research
- When the two cities of focus were studied together, it was found that the data
 from the built-up area and floods were closely related, indicating that as
  cities grew, flood severity increased. However, when the cities were studied
   separately, it was observed that floods reduced as the cities expanded.
- There is **a lack of high-quality, consistent data** covering critical
 factors like topography, land use, drainage infrastructure, population, and exposure
 to strengthen the study.
- Our synthetic dataset offers a starting point for hypothesis testing, model
 building, or even local validation studies.

### How We Hope They Will Act  

- Use our open-source datasets to **replicate, validate, or extend** our analysis.
- **Contribute new data**, such as ground-truth flood observations,
 infrastructure maps, or more granular urban growth layers.
- Collaborate across fields, e.g., urban planners working with climate
 scientists, to close data gaps and generate holistic solutions.
- Publish further studies or tools that can inform policy and planning in
 data-scarce urban regions.

## Secondary Target Audience

## **Inter Governmental Authority on Development**(IGAD)

**Capabilities:**  

- IGAD’s mission includes regional cooperation on environmental protection,
 climate resilience, and disaster risk reduction.
- IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) works on climate risk
 and early warning systems, including flood forecasting.
- IGAD Disaster Risk Management Programme focuses on building resilience to
 natural hazards.

**Constraints:**  

- Funding limitations
- Responses to proposals may take weeks or even months

**How we intend to Reach Them:**  

- Sending them a proposal through email with:  

  - Why the project matters to IGAD’s mission
  - Data needs
  - Potential collaboration or support required
  - Expected outcomes
  - Supporting infographics to show our findings better

**What We Want Them to Learn:**  

- The rapid growth of cities in the nile basin increases vulnerability to flooding
 which threatens regional development goals, infrastructure, and population safety.
- Flood severity isn't only about city expansion but depends on whether urban
 growth is planned or unplanned.
- Kampala indicates higher vulnerability, highlighting a need for city-specific
 resilience strategies.
- Severe data scarcity is limiting good planning and disaster preparedness in the
 region.
- Better data-sharing frameworks (rainfall, land use, infrastructure, population
 exposure) could support both researchers and policymakers.

**How We Hope They Will Act:**  

- Support regional data-sharing between countries.
- Fund or facilitate pilot studies in vulnerable urban areas.
