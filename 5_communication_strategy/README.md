# Communication Strategy

## Primary Target Audience

__Persona:__ The Academic Researcher  
__Name:__ Dr. Nkechi Adebayo  
__Role:__ Post-Doctoral Fellow in Geospatial Science and Climate Adaptation  
__Age:__ 32  
__Bio:__ Dr. Adebayo is an ambitious early-career researcher based at a leading Ethiopian university. Her work focuses on using remote sensing and machine learning to understand climate change impacts on urban environments. She is passionate about producing high-impact research that is relevant to her region's challenges. She is a digital native, highly active on academic social networks, and a strong believer in open-source science.

### Her Capabilities (Our Opportunities)

Dr. Adebayo represents the skilled, next-generation researcher we want to engage.

__Technical Expertise:__ She is fluent in Python and R, an expert in handling satellite imagery (like Landsat and Sentinel), and comfortable with advanced statistical and machine learning models. She will understand and appreciate the technical rigor of our work, including the synthetic data generation.  
__Familiarity with Open Science:__ Our GitHub repository is her natural environment. She knows how to fork a repo and assess the quality of a project based on its documentation and code structure.  
__Driven by Publication:__ Her career progression depends on publishing novel research in reputable journals. She is actively looking for new datasets, methods, and research questions that can lead to a high-impact paper.

### Her Constraints (Our Solutions)

Her primary challenges are precisely what our project aims to alleviate.

__Funding and Time Limitations:__ As a post-doc, she lacks the large grants needed for foundational data collection (e.g., commissioning new satellite imagery or conducting large-scale ground surveys). She needs projects that can be built upon, not started from scratch.

### Our Engagement Strategy

__How We Will Reach Her:__

__Academic Networks:__ We will share our findings and link to the repository in relevant journals( __Meteorology Hydrology and Water Management, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science and Journal of Coastal and Riverine Flood Risk__) and academic conferences.

### What We Want Her to Learn

__The Complexity of the Issue:__ She will appreciate our finding that urban growth alone is an incomplete explanation. Our model, which shows the complex interplay between urban extent, precipitation, and flood outcomes, will give her a more nuanced understanding of the problem.

__Collaboration:__ She will see the "Limitations" section of our work not as a weakness, but as an open invitation‚Äîa map of the existing data gaps (infrastructure, population vulnerability) that she and others can help fill.

### How We Hope She Will Act (Our Ideal Outcome)

Our goal is to turn Dr. Adebayo from a passive reader into an active collaborator.

__Extend and Innovate:__ She will build upon our work by adding new variables to the model. She could integrate layers for soil type, elevation, or the location of informal settlements to see how they influence flood risk, publishing a novel study in the process.

__Contribute Back:__ As a believer in open science, she will submit her improvements‚Äîwhether it's refined code, new data layers, or bug fixes‚Äîback to our original repository as a pull request, strengthening the tool for the entire community.
Foster Interdisciplinary Work: Inspired by the data gaps, she will collaborate with colleagues in sociology or public health to integrate vulnerability data, leading to a more holistic understanding of flood impact on human populations.
