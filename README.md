Exploring Data Science with Python ‚Äî Learning Together, Building Trust.

## Who are we? üåü

We are a group of passionate data science enthusiasts who believe in the power
 of collaboration and shared learning. Our mission is to explore the vast world
  of data science using Python, while fostering a supportive community where
   everyone can grow and thrive.

### Research Topics

- Climate Displacement
- Climate Injustice
- Extreme Weather conditions predicition

### üöÄ Problem Statement

Climate change is increasingly forcing millions of people worldwide to flee their
homes due to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, prolonged droughts, and
catastrophic flooding. Unlike traditional migration, climate displacement is
often sudden, involuntary, and leaves affected populations with no safe return
options. Without urgent intervention, the World Bank estimates that over 216
million people could be displaced within their own countries by 2050 due to
climate-related impacts, particularly in
developing countries, which lack sufficient infrastructure, technology, and means.

For example, in South Sudan, increasingly severe and frequent flooding, caused
by heavy rainfall and overflow from rivers like the Nile and its tributaries,
submerge homes, destroy crops, drown livestock, and displace thousands of people.
Despite these recurring disasters, current disaster response mechanisms are
largely reactive rather than proactive, due to the lack of sufficient infrastruc
ture, technology, and predictive systems to effectively anticipate and mitigate
flood damage.

This is where data science can play a transformative role. By leveraging
satellite imagery, hydrological data, current and historical climate data, such
as flood patterns, together with machine learning models, we can develop early
warning systems, improve flood forecasting, and optimize emergency response
efforts. Accordingly, this project seeks to investigate how data-driven
approaches could help reduce displacement, save lives, and protect livelihoods
in vulnerable regions of South Sudan, as well as other countries

### üî¨ Actionable Research Questions

__In what ways can data-driven approaches address flood-related climate
 displacement
in South Sudan, and what policy measures are needed to support these solutions?__
