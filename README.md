### üöÄ Problem Statement

Urban flooding is becoming increasingly common in rapidly growing cities. As
cities expand, natural land surfaces are replaced with buildings, roads,
and other infrastructure. This change __reduces the land‚Äôs ability to
absorb rainfall__, potentially leading to more severe and frequent floods.
Despite these concerns, there is limited data-driven research quantifying the
relationship between urbanization and flood extent in the __East African__ regions.

This is where data science can play a transformative role. By leveraging
satellite imagery, hydrological data, current and historical climate data, such
as flood patterns, together with machine learning models, we can develop early
warning systems, improve flood forecasting, and optimize emergency response
efforts.The goal is __to support better urban planning and disaster risk management
by providing a clearer understanding of how unchecked urban growth may influence
flood risks.__

## üî¨ Actionable Research Questions

 __*How has urban expansion influenced the frequency and*__
 __*spatial extent of the flood events in Kampala and Addis Ababa, considering*__
  __*rainfall variability?*__

### üß© A Non Technical Explanation On How We Chose To Model The Domain?

We wanted to understand how the growth of cities like __Kampala and Addis Ababa__
 over the last two decades might be making floods worse, especially when
  combined with changing rainfall patterns. Our goal was to use real satellite
   data to explore whether there's a __connection between urban growth, rainfall,
    and flood events__, and what that might mean for future city planning.
To do this, we looked at three main types of data:

- üèòÔ∏è __Urban Extent__ - *How much of each city is covered by buildings or built-up*
 *land each year*.

- üåßÔ∏è __Rainfall__ ‚Äì *How much rain fell each month, using high-resolution*
 *satellite rainfall maps*.

- üåä __Flood Extent__ ‚Äì *How much of each city was covered by floodwaters each month*,
 *based on flood mapping from satellite images*.

Since these data sets all come in __different formats and time scales__ (some are
 monthly, others are yearly), we standardized everything to an __annual scale__,
  so we could compare them year by year. These are the
   [cleaning scripts](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-01-repo/tree/main/2_data_preparation/cleaning_scripts)üßπ
    we used for the datasets. We combined the three datasets into one big table
     where each row represents a year for a city, with columns for:

- üåßÔ∏è Total rainfall in that year
- üèôÔ∏è Amount of urbanized land
- üåä How much flooding occurred

This allowed us to look for patterns like:

1. Do floods get worse in years when urban areas grow fast?

2. Is there more flooding in years with heavier rainfall?

3. Do both factors (rain + buildings) work together to cause floods?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Flaws In Our Approach

üîÅ __Different data time ranges__  

Rainfall and urban extent data go back to 2005 , but flood data only starts
 in 2015. Also, the urban extent data was sourced from two sources with the
  sourced data from Dynamic World that starts from `2021-2025` not being
   consistent with that sourced from `MODIS`(`2001-2020`).  So, we can only
    model trends from `2015‚Äì2020`, making us deal with limited data than we
     would've needed.

üèóÔ∏è __Urban area does not capture infrastructure quality__  

Urban extent only tells us how much of the land is built-up, but it doesn‚Äôt
 tell us if there are proper drainage systems, green spaces, or flood defenses.

üìÖ __Annual summaries may hide short-term extremes__  

Floods often happen due to intense rainfall in a few days or weeks. Our yearly
 totals may smooth out those spikes.

üå•Ô∏è __Flood data is sometimes incomplete__  

Some flood maps from satellites may miss small or fast-dissipating flood events
 due to cloud cover, revisit gaps, or low image quality.
