## Presentation Script

We structured our presentation on the following core points;

### 1. Original Problem Statement

Floods in rapidly growing cities in the Nile Basin, such as Kampala and Addis Ababa,
 are becoming increasingly frequent.  
This could be a result of replacing natural land surfaces with buildings, roads,
 and other infrastructure, which reduces the land’s ability to absorb rainfall.

Limited data-driven research in this area motivated us to study the root causes
 of floods in these cities and explore the possibility of predicting future
  population exposures.

---

### 2. Challenges & Pivots

- **Initial Focus**: Climate displacement in South Sudan, studying flood impacts
 and predicting population exposures, with recommendations for the government.  
- **Challenge**: Severe data scarcity in South Sudan forced us to pivot.  
- **Refined Focus**: Impacts of urbanization on floods in Kampala and Addis Ababa.
- **Remaining Challenge**: Limited data on topography, land use, infrastructure,
 population, and exposure.
- **Adjustment**: Scaled down goals to focus on the relationship between floods,
 rainfall, and built-up areas. Synthetic data was used to fill in missing years.

### 3. Final Research Question

**How has urban expansion influenced the frequency and spatial extent of flood
 events in Kampala and Addis Ababa, considering rainfall variability?**

---

### 4. Research Results

- When **both cities** were analyzed together → built-up areas and floods were
 closely related:  
  **More growth = more severe floods**.  
- When **studied separately** → a paradox appeared:  
  Floods sometimes reduced as cities expanded.  
- **Key finding**:  
  - Years with high urban growth rates → worse floods.  
  - Suggests unchecked expansion outpaces drainage and infrastructure.  
- **Kampala vs. Addis Ababa**: Kampala experienced more severe floods, possibly
 due to its hilly topography (built on ~27 hills).

---

### 5. Key Takeaways

- City-level analysis is essential → combining cities can hide unique dynamics.
- Urban growth does **not always** mean worse floods.  
- Unchecked and rapid expansion without adequate planning leads to frequent flooding.

---

### 6. Uncertainties

- Reliance on **synthetic data** may introduce bias → not fully representative of
 ground realities.
- Datasets were scaled to **yearly values**, meaning short-term rainfall extremes
 (often the real flood drivers) weren’t captured.  

---

### 7. Communication Strategy

- **Researchers**:  
  - Share our scientific paper, to be published on
   [Meteorology Hydrology and Water Management](https://www.mhwm.pl/About-the-Journal,662.html).
  - Sent LinkedIn messages summarizing our project and linking to the GitHub repository.
- **Intergovernmental Bodies** (e.g., IGAD):  
  - Reached out via e-mail.  
  - Goal: raise awareness about the link between urban growth and flooding.  
  - Highlighted the **data scarcity** issue and encouraged collaboration.

## Closing

Our study highlights the complex relationship between urban expansion and floods
 in Nile Basin cities.  
Better data and collaboration with domain experts will allow deeper insights and
 stronger policy recommendations.
