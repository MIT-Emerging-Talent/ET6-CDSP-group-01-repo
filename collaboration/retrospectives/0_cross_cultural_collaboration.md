# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

‚Ä¢ Stop assuming all team members understand the context equally‚Äîcultural  
  and language differences can lead to miscommunication.

‚Ä¢ Stop scheduling meetings without considering different time zones,  
  which causes fatigue or absenteeism.

‚Ä¢ Stop delaying feedback‚Äîwaiting too long slows our momentum.

## Continue Doing

‚Ä¢ Continue using shared documents and cloud-based tools to collaborate in real time.

‚Ä¢ Continue being respectful of cultural differences and open to diverse viewpoints.

‚Ä¢ Continue assigning clear roles and responsibilities to avoid duplication.

‚Ä¢ Continue conducting regular check-ins to maintain accountability and track progress.

## Start Doing

‚Ä¢ Start creating quick summary notes after meetings to ensure everyone is aligned.

‚Ä¢ Start setting clearer short-term goals during long-term projects to maintain focus.

## Lessons Learned

‚Ä¢ Flexibility is essential‚Äîplans often need to change due to time  
  zone constraints or unexpected technical issues.

‚Ä¢ Over-communication is better than under-communication when working online.

‚Ä¢ Cultural sensitivity isn‚Äôt just a value‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity for smooth collaboration.

‚Ä¢ Trust and clarity build over time, but both need to be actively nurtured.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

‚Ä¢ The division of tasks among members based on skill sets worked very well.

‚Ä¢ Using collaboration tools like Google Drive and Google Meet  
  facilitated coordination effectively.

‚Ä¢ The majority of deadlines were met thanks to good planning and proactive follow-ups.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

‚Ä¢ Some tasks took longer due to internet issues or lack of  
  access to resources in certain regions.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

‚Ä¢ Yes, we added a shared Notion page to keep our files organized.

‚Ä¢ We included an informal group chat to build rapport and improve team dynamics.

### Or remove extra steps?

‚Ä¢ We simplified the document review process by assigning one lead  
  reviewer instead of group review sessions.
