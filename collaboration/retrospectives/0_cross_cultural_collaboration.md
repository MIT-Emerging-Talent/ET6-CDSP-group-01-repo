# 🔄 Retrospective

## ✋ Stop Doing

• Stop assuming all team members understand the context equally—cultural  
  and language differences can lead to miscommunication.

• Stop scheduling meetings without considering different time zones,  
  which causes fatigue or absenteeism.

• Stop delaying feedback—waiting too long slows our momentum.

## 🔄✅ Continue Doing

• Continue using shared documents and cloud-based tools to collaborate in real time.

• Continue being respectful of cultural differences and open to diverse viewpoints.

• Continue assigning clear roles and responsibilities to avoid duplication.

• Continue conducting regular check-ins to maintain accountability and track progress.

## 🚀 Start Doing

• Start creating quick summary notes after meetings to ensure everyone is aligned.

• Start setting clearer short-term goals during long-term projects to maintain focus.

## 📚💡 Lessons Learned

• Flexibility is essential—plans often need to change due to time  
  zone constraints or unexpected technical issues.

• Over-communication is better than under-communication when working online.

• Cultural sensitivity isn’t just a value—it’s a necessity for smooth collaboration.

• Trust and clarity build over time, but both need to be actively nurtured.

## 🏆📊 Strategy vs. Board

### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

• The division of tasks among members based on skill sets worked very well.

• Using collaboration tools like Google Drive and Google Meet  
  facilitated coordination effectively.

• The majority of deadlines were met thanks to good planning and proactive follow-ups.

### ❌ What parts of your plan did not work out?

• Some tasks took longer due to internet issues or lack of  
  access to resources in certain regions.

### ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

• Yes, we added a shared Notion page to keep our files organized.

• We included an informal group chat to build rapport and improve team dynamics.

### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

• We simplified the document review process by assigning one lead  
  reviewer instead of group review sessions.
