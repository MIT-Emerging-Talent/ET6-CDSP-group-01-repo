# Milestone 1 Retrospective

## üìå Strategy vs. Board

### ‚úÖ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Coming up with a unilateral research question.
- Finishing the tasks before the deadline.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Not all of us in the group were available to continue with the deliverables
as originally planned.

### ‚ûï Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We had to first inform others about the data availability for our
- suggested research questions during the convergence thinking process.

---

### üõë Stop Doing

- Delaying planning, task listing, and early role assignment.
- Being unavailable for extended periods without notifying the team.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Continue Doing

- Holding discussion meetings at the agreed-upon times.
- Monitoring the syllabus and project board to stay aligned with deliverables
- and deadlines.
- Using Slack and GitHub effectively for asynchronous communication and documentation.
- Encouraging team-wide input when making decisions.

### üÜï Start Doing

- Giving ourselves enough time to work on deliverables with a buffer for delays.
- Actively communicating when someone is busy.
- Regularly updating each other on progress for assigned tasks.

### üí° Lessons Learned

- Leveraging the diverse backgrounds of each team member leads to richer ideas.
- Proactivity pays off in both planning and execution.
- Starting with a clear structure helps avoid obstacles and last-minute stress.

## üë§ Individual Retrospectives

## Samuel Gai

**What have you learned?**

- How to identify a research problem using systems thinking.
- Gained a better understanding of divergent and convergent thinking through
  the milestone process.

**What went well?**

- Coming up with a general, focused research topic and question.

**What could be improved?**

- In the early stages, we had a variety of topic suggestions, which made
  convergence a bit difficult and time consuming.

### Rama Arafeh

**What have you learned?**

- *Valuing Collaborative Input:* Engaging with the group introduced perspectives
I hadn‚Äôt considered, and ultimately, we chose a problem that I had initially overlooked,
 highlighting the value of fresh ideas from others.
- *Building Technical Skills:* I gained practical support and guidance on using
GitHub, which helped me better understand tools and workflows I was less familiar
 with.
- *Appreciating Diverse Perspectives:* Throughout our work, we encountered
  different interpretations‚Äîfor example, how to format files or where to place
  certain information‚Äîbut through discussion, we resolved these differences and
  benefited from the range of viewpoints.

**What went well?**

- Despite limited technical experience, I met all deadlines and kept up with the
   pace.

**What can be improved?**

- The decision-making process could be faster with clearer communication.

### Hiba Daffallah

**What have you learned?**

- I learned how important it is to have domain knowledge when choosing the
  research question

**What went well?**

- We reached a common ground and chose a domain we are all interested in, and we
   were all open-minded

**What can be improved?**

- The decision process took more time than I expected can be improved with better
   communication

### Amin Abd Elraheem

**What have you learned?**

- I‚Äôve gained further knowledge on climate issues, their interconnection, and the
   role of data science in addressing these issues.

**What went well?**

- Collectively coming up with a relevant and specific research question using
  systems thinking.

**What could be improved?**

- The divergence and convergence processes took much time, but the better
  understanding of the domain throughout the process led the group to a
faster pace later on.

### Nada Ali

**What have you learned?**

- Discovered the power of *active listening* and flexibility in building shared direction.
- Learned how personal experiences can strengthen team motivation and connection.

**What went well?**

- Consistently used Slack for communication and GitHub for documentation.

**What can be improved?**

- Want to improve at estimating task timelines to reduce last-minute stress.
