# Milestone 2 Retrospective

## üìå Strategy vs. Board

### ‚úÖ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Weekly meetings and task assignments were effective in maintaining progress.
- Getting most of the critical datasets required to answer our refined research question.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Difficulty finding specific datasets required for the project.
- Getting all the accurate datasets to effectively answer our research question.

### ‚ûï Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Added buffer time for emergencies to avoid last-minute rushes.  
- We had to refine our research question to something where we can find
data as our initial question had critical datasets missing.

### üõë Stop Doing

- Delaying tasks and postponing critical work.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Continue Doing

- Open discussions where everyone shares opinions and asks for help when needed.
- The frequent attendance of our group meetings and continued clarification as
to why we aren‚Äôt able to attend in advance.

### üÜï Start Doing

- Embracing new challenges outside our comfort zones to expand knowledge and skills.

### üí° Lessons Learned

- It‚Äôs okay to feel lost and restart‚Äîprogress matters more than perfection.  
- Being late (but committed) is better than not contributing at all.

### Hiba Daffallah

**What have you learned?**

- I‚Äôve learned the importance of documenting the data collection process to keep
track of the sources of each data source and how to handle data in .tif format.

**What went well?**

- The data cleaning process

**What can be improved?**

- Asynchronous communication using slack to discuss issues so the weekly team
meetings can be more helpful

### Amin Abd Elraheem

**What have you learned?**

- Persistent collective work leads to overcoming many difficulties along the way.

**What went well?**

- The process of defining the research question and the objectives, also the
data collection and cleaning.

### Nada Ali

**What have you learned?**

- I‚Äôve learned that flexibility is key , sometimes the research direction needs
to shift based on what‚Äôs realistically available. I also realized how important
it is to build in extra time for unexpected challenges and to not stress too
much about doing everything perfectly on the first try.

**What went well?**

- Weekly meetings helped maintain momentum and provided space for everyone to
share updates or ask for support.

**What can be improved?**

- Some tasks were delayed due to difficulty finding the right data. Starting
earlier and communicating blockers more quickly would have helped avoid
last-minute stress.
