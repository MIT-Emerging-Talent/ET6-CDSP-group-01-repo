# Milestone 3 Retrospective

## üìå Strategy vs. Board

### ‚úÖ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Weekly meetings and clear task distribution kept our analysis workflow on track.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We were unable to gather all the high-quality data required to fully support
  our initial research question.
- Due to the limited availability of only five years of historical data, the
  planned data analysis was not feasible without incorporating synthetic data
  to ensure meaningful patterns

### ‚ûï Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We incorporated buffer time in our schedule to accommodate delays, reducing
  the risk of last-minute work under pressure.

- We revised our research question to better align with the datasets that were
  accessible, improving the feasibility of the analysis.

---

### üõë Stop Doing

- Procrastinating or deferring essential tasks, which hinders momentum in data
  exploration and analysis.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Continue Doing

- Maintaining open dialogue during meetings, where team members feel safe to
  ask for support or share ideas.

- Staying committed to regular meeting attendance and giving advance notice
  when unavailable.

### üÜï Start Doing

- Tackling unfamiliar analytical tools or methods to build technical versatility
  and deepen understanding.

### üí° Lessons Learned

- It‚Äôs okay to revise or restart part of the analysis process‚Äîsteady progress
  is more valuable than early perfection.

- Late contributions are still meaningful when they show dedication; staying
  involved is better than stepping back entirely.

- We learned to work within the given timeframe by making practical decisions ‚Äî
  like generating synthetic data ‚Äî instead of changing the core focus of our project.

## üë§ Individual Retrospectives

## Samuel Gai

**What have you learned?**

- When to use a specific analysis technique to answer a research question

**What went well?**

- The process of generating synthetic data to better support our research question.

**What could be improved?**

- Better communicating tasks an individual is handling.

### Rama Arafeh

**What have you learned?**

- I began exploring data analysis at a pace appropriate to my current level and
  available time. While my progress has been gradual, I believe that
  consistent, incremental learning is more valuable than not engaging with the
  subject at all.

**What went well?**

- Despite facing significant challenges, including periods without electricity
  or internet access, I remained committed to the project and was still able to
  make limited contributions whenever possible.

**What can be improved?**

- I recognize the importance of being better prepared for unforeseen
  circumstances and will work on planning ahead to minimize the impact of such
  disruptions in the future.

### Hiba Daffallah

**What have you learned?**

- Generating a synthetic dataset and controlling and documenting the process.
- Being open and flexible because the output might turn out opposite of what‚Äôs expected

**What went well?**

- The meetings attendance was good

**What can be improved?**

- Giving ourselves buffer time before the deadline to tackle any unexpected
  problems. Also our asynchronous communication in slack can be improved

### Amin Abd Elraheem

**What have you learned?**

- I have learnt how to extract and process data from alternative sources, other
  than direct datasets

**What went well?**

- Overcoming the data limitations

**What could be improved?**

- Finding more data on other aspects of floods impact on population, in order
  to get further insights

### Nada Ali

**What have you learned?**

- Learned how to create and generate synthetic data that closely mimics real data.
- Gained experience in identifying and replicating patterns, trends, and noise
  from actual datasets.
- Developed skills in analyzing data and extracting meaningful insights.
- Learned how to document notebooks clearly so that others can easily
  understand and follow the work.

**What went well?**

- the process of creating synthetic data and catching the milestone deadline.

**What can be improved?**

- communicating with the ET team as early as possible when facing issues, as
  some problems may take longer to resolve and early notice can speed up the process.
