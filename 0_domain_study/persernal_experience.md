As a South Sudanese citizen from Jonglei State, I have witnessed firsthand the
 devastating impact of recurring floods on our communities. Every year, heavy
  rainfall and overflow from rivers like the Nile and its tributaries submerge
   homes, destroy crops, drown livestock, and displace thousands of people.
    The 2020 and 2021 floods were particularly catastrophic, leaving many
     families homeless, increasing food insecurity, and spreading waterborne
      diseases like cholera. Despite these recurring disasters, there is still
       a lack of effective early warning systems, proper flood monitoring, and
        data-driven strategies to mitigate the damage.

The general problem is that **South Sudan lacks sufficient infrastructure,
 technology, and predictive systems** to effectively anticipate and manage
  floods. Traditional response mechanisms are often reactive rather than
   proactive, resulting in unnecessary loss of lives and livelihoods.
    Additionally, climate change is worsening rainfall patterns,making floods
     more frequent and severe. Without reliable flood prediction models,
      real-time monitoring systems, and data-informed disaster management
       policies, vulnerable communities in Jonglei and other flood-prone
        regions remain at high risk.

This is where **data science can play a transformative role**. By leveraging
 satellite imagery, hydrological data, machine learning models, and historical
  flood patterns, we can develop early warning systems, improve flood
   forecasting, and optimize emergency response efforts. If implemented
    effectively, data-driven approaches could help reduce displacement,
     save lives, and protect livelihoods in South Sudan’s most vulnerable regions.

As someone originally from Syria and now living in a village in Lebanon, I find
 it very difficult that drought is affecting both places—my hometown in Syria
  and the village where I live now. This past winter, there was barely any
   precipitation, and now, in the summer, there’s almost no water to rely on.
    Natural sources like springs and wells have dried up, and we’ve been forced
     to start buying water just to cover basic needs like drinking and washing.
      It’s not easy, especially with the financial pressure it adds. Around us,
       some families have already been displaced because they can no longer
        survive without water. Even though we haven’t had to leave, we feel the
         impact of the drought every single day. Water has become something we
          worry about constantly—something that used to be a part of life, but
           now feels like it’s slipping out of reach.
