# üìö Background Review

## üåç Introduction

Urban flooding has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges facing
 rapidly expanding cities in developing regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, where
  urbanization is accelerating at unprecedented rates, the risks associated
   with unplanned growth and climate variability are becoming increasingly
    visible. Cities such as **Kampala** (Uganda) and **Addis Ababa** (Ethiopia)
     are emblematic of this trend, experiencing both high population growth and
      recurring flood events.

The focus of this study is to investigate the relationship between
 **urban expansion**, **rainfall variability**, and **flood extent** in these
  two East African cities. Understanding this relationship is crucial for
   informed urban planning, disaster preparedness, and climate resilience strategies.

### üèôÔ∏è Urbanization in East Africa

According to the UN-Habitat and World Bank reports, African cities are among
 the fastest growing globally, but much of this growth is **informal** and
  **infrastructure-poor**. The expansion of impervious surfaces (e.g., roads,
   rooftops, pavements) drastically reduces the capacity of land to absorb
    rainwater. As a result, runoff increases, and drainage systems, if present
     are quickly overwhelmed.
This process has led to a growing number of **urban flash floods**, often
 affecting the poorest and most vulnerable populations.

In cities like Kampala and Addis Ababa:

- Urban land cover has increased dramatically since the early 2000s.
- New developments often outpace investments in drainage, green infrastructure,
 or zoning enforcement.
- Built-up areas tend to emerge in flood-prone zones, amplifying exposure and risk.

### üåßÔ∏è Rainfall Variability and Climate Change

Climate change is intensifying the hydrological cycle. Even though East Africa
 does not face the same scale of sea-level rise or cyclonic storms as some
  coastal regions, it does experience **more frequent and intense rainfall
   events**, especially during the long rains (March‚ÄìMay) and short rains (October‚ÄìDecember).

This unpredictability makes traditional infrastructure planning ineffective.
 Additionally, extreme rainfall concentrated over a few hours or days can
  overwhelm even well-designed drainage systems, particularly when combined
   with poor solid waste management (which clogs drains).

### üåä Urban Flooding and Its Impacts

The consequences of urban flooding extend beyond physical damage to homes and
 infrastructure. Floods in urban centers lead to:

- Health crises (e.g., waterborne diseases like cholera).
- Disruption of transportation and commerce.
- School closures and reduced access to services.
- Displacement of populations, sometimes permanently.
- Increased poverty and loss of livelihoods.

Yet, despite the growing prevalence of these events, **data-driven studies**
 **quantifying the link between urban growth and flooding in East African**
  **cities are limited**.

### üì° The Role of Data Science and Earth Observation

Recent advances in **remote sensing**, **geospatial analysis**, and
 **machine learning** offer powerful tools to bridge this knowledge gap. For instance:

- Urban extent can be extracted from satellite platforms like MODIS,
 Sentinel-2, and Dynamic World.
- Rainfall data is available at high spatial resolution from sources like
 CHIRPS and GPM.
- Flood events can be detected through SAR imagery (e.g., Sentinel-1) and
 optical satellites, even during cloud cover.

By integrating these datasets and analyzing them over time, researchers can
 uncover patterns that were previously hidden, such as:

- Correlations between urban growth rates and flood frequency/intensity.
- How rainfall variability modifies flood risk.
- Whether both factors are acting independently or synergistically.

### üéØ Research Question

> **How has urban expansion over the past two decades influenced the frequency**
 **and spatial extent of flood events in Kampala and Addis Ababa, considering**
 **rainfall variability during the same period?**

### üîç Research Gaps

This research aims to address key gaps:

- **Temporal gaps**: Limited longitudinal studies tracking urban growth and
 flooding side-by-side.
- **Spatial gaps**: Few comparative analyses across cities in the East African context.
- **Methodological gaps**: Limited integration of remote sensing, hydrology,
 and data science in local flood research.
- **Policy gaps**: A lack of actionable, localized insights to support urban
 planners in flood-prone cities.
