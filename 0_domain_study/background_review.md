# Climate Displacement

**Climate Displacement** refers to the movement of people due to sudden or
 gradual environmental changes caused by climate change.

## Problem statement

Climate change is increasingly forcing millions of people worldwide to flee
their homes due to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, prolonged
droughts, deforestation and catastrophic flooding. Unlike traditional
migration, climate displacement is often sudden, involuntary, and leaves
affected populations with no safe return options. Without urgent
intervention, the World Bank estimates that over 216 million people could
be displaced within their own countries by 2050 due to climate-related impacts.

### **Key Challenges of Climate Displacement**

- **Lack of Early Warning & Preparedness** – *Many vulnerable regions lack
predictive systems to anticipate disasters, leaving communities with little
time to evacuate or adapt*.
- **Inadequate Legal Protections** – *Climate migrants often fall into legal gaps,*
*as international refugee laws do not recognize them as formal refugees*.
- **Loss of Livelihoods & Increased Poverty** – *Displacement disrupts*
*agriculture, fishing, and other climate-dependent livelihoods, pushing*
*populations into extreme poverty*.
- **Conflict & Social Instability** – *Mass migration strains resources in host*
*communities, increasing tensions over land, water, and food security*.
- **Urban Overcrowding & Slum Expansion** – *Many displaced people move to cities*,
*overwhelming infrastructure and creating informal settlements with poor*
*sanitation and healthcare*.
- **Gender & Social Inequities** – *Women, children, and marginalized groups face*
*higher risks of exploitation, trafficking, and reduced access to aid.*

### **The Role of Data Science & Policy Interventions**

To address this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations must
leverage data-driven solutions, including:
Predictive modeling using climate data, satellite imagery, and AI to forecast
displacement risks.
Real-time monitoring systems to track migration patterns and optimize aid distribution.
Policy frameworks that recognize climate migrants and support planned
relocation or resilience programs.

Without coordinated global action, climate displacement will escalate,
leading to unprecedented humanitarian crises, economic losses, and
geopolitical instability. The world must act now to protect the most
vulnerable and build adaptive solutions before entire regions become uninhabitable.

### **Impacts of Flooding in South Sudan**

- **People**: Hundreds of thousands displaced, with homes destroyed and lives lost.
- **Health**: Spikes in waterborne diseases (cholera, malaria), and rising malnutrition.
- **Livelihoods**: Crops and livestock wiped out, food prices rising, incomes lost.
- **Education**: Schools flooded or turned into shelters, disrupting learning
for thousands.
- **Infrastructure**: Roads, clinics, and markets submerged, blocking aid and
isolating communities.

## Personal experience statement

**Samuel Gai**:  
As a South Sudanese citizen from Jonglei State, I have witnessed firsthand the
devastating impact of recurring floods on our communities. Every year, heavy
rainfall and overflow from rivers like the Nile and its tributaries submerge
homes, destroy crops, drown livestock, and displace thousands of people. The
2020 and 2021 floods were particularly catastrophic, leaving many families
homeless, increasing food insecurity, and spreading waterborne diseases
like cholera. Despite these recurring disasters, there is still a lack of
effective early warning systems, proper flood monitoring, and
data-driven strategies to mitigate the damage.

The general problem is that South Sudan lacks sufficient infrastructure,
technology, and predictive systems to effectively anticipate and manage
floods. Traditional response mechanisms are often reactive rather than
proactive, resulting in unnecessary loss of lives and livelihoods.
Additionally, climate change is worsening rainfall patterns, making floods
more frequent and severe. Without reliable flood prediction models,
real-time monitoring systems, and data-informed disaster management
policies, vulnerable communities in Jonglei and other flood-prone
regions remain at high risk.

This is where data science can play a transformative role. By leveraging
satellite imagery, hydrological data, machine learning models, and historical
flood patterns, we can develop early warning systems, improve flood
forecasting, and optimize emergency response efforts. If implemented
effectively, data-driven approaches could help reduce displacement, save
lives, and protect livelihoods in South Sudan’s most vulnerable regions.

**Rama's Personal Experience Statement**:  
As someone originally from Syria and now
living in a village in Lebanon, I find it very difficult that drought is
affecting both places—my hometown in Syria and the village where I live now.
This past winter, there was barely any precipitation, and now, in the
summer, there’s almost no water to rely on. Natural sources like springs
and wells have dried up, and we’ve been forced to start buying water just
to cover basic needs like drinking and washing. It’s not easy,
especially with the financial pressure it adds. Around us, some families
have already been displaced because they can no longer survive without
water. Even though we haven’t had to leave, we feel the impact of the
drought every single day. Water has become something we worry about
constantly—something that used to be a part of life, but now feels
like it’s slipping out of reach.

### **Question of focus**

*In what ways can data-driven approaches address flood-related climate*
*displacement in South Sudan, and what policy measures are needed to support*
*these solutions?*

### **Research gaps on the focused topic**

Highlighting gaps is important because it reveals areas that need further
exploration, encourages innovative thinking, and ensures that overlooked
issues, communities, or data are brought into focus. Some of the gaps include:

**Flood forecasts are not tied to displacement risks**  
**No early warning for displacements**  
**There’s a lack of resettlement planning**  
**There is limited research on long-term flood management strategies, such
as**:  

- *Sustainable land and water management*
- *Climate-resilient infrastructure*

**There is limited exploration of how floods interact with ongoing conflict**:  

- *How flooding may fuel tensions over resources*
- *How displacement from floods overlaps with displacement from violence*
