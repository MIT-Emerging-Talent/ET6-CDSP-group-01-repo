We had two weeks to decide which research questions should our research focus on.
To decide we followed two techiques __Convergent__ and __Divergent__ thinking.

- __Divergent Thinking__:
  
  All members shared their interests and found that we are all
  interested in __climate__ and __education__. So we decided to search for a
  climate related
  questions and add all our ideas to a common [folder.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sP7SEOIk5nfMWbOkqMjhV4sDKyj_dIqOehNsN90ySrw/edit?tab=t.0)
  Most of the suggested topics were broad so we started to search in Google Scholar
   to widen our understading in the topics and to find gaps in the suggested topics.

- __Convergent Thinking__:
  
 We made a thorough research in the topics and shortlisted them using __FRESCO__
 and __PICOT__ frameworks into the following:

Lastly, We had a meeting and discussed the shortlised questions and decided on
our final question.
