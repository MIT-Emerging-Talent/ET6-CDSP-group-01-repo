# The process of forming and understanding the problem

Initially, as a group, we discussed our domains of interest, and found out that
we all share the interest on _climate_ issues.
We then thought about the problems of interest to each one of us, and came up
with different questions based on our search (that we may group as follows):
grouped as follows:

• __Climate issues__: Climate Change; Climate Sustainability; Predicting Climate-
induced Ecosystem Changes, Climate injustice.

• __AI Impact on Climate__ (in good / bad ways)

•  __Renewable energy__: Resilience of Solar and Wind Power Generation in Extreme
Weather Events; Solar Power Production Forecasting.

• __Flooding__: How Can Data-Science Help in Predicting, Monitoring, and Reducing
the Impacts of Floods.

• __Education__: How Does Pupil-to-Teacher Ratio in Refugee Settlements Impacts
Primary Education Quality.

After further research and discussions, we found out that many of the climate
issues are interconnected and could be considered as parts of a whole when you
try to study any of the problems, e.g. Climate change, Ecosystem changes,
Extreme weather events, Predictive modelling, and Data and AI impact.
By using systems thinking we understood that we can’t look at any of the issues
in isolation; therefore, we formed the research question as:

 _“In what ways can data-driven approaches address flood-related climate
displacement in South Sudan, and what policy measures are needed to support
these solutions?”_

In this question we tried to systematically consider the interconnection of
different aspects of flooding, including the climate, social, legal, and
technology issues in this era of data and AI.
