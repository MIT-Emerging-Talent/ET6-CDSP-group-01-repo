# The process of forming and understanding the problem

After research and discussions, we found out that many of the climate
issues are interconnected and could be considered as parts of a whole when you
try to study any of the problems, e.g. Climate change, Ecosystem changes,
Extreme weather events, Predictive modelling, and Data and AI impact.
By using systems thinking we understood that we canâ€™t look at any of the issues
in isolation.

## ðŸ”„ System Thinking

The displacement crisis is not a singular event but the outcome of a dynamic
system. Floodingâ€”exacerbated by climate changeâ€”displaces families, destroys
homes, and interrupts food production. The loss of crops and livestock leads to
food insecurity, which in turn drives up prices, deepens poverty, and stresses
health systems. Displacement into urban areas contributes to overcrowded
informal settlements where sanitation is poor, disease spreads, and
infrastructure collapses.This results in negative feedback loopsâ€”where one
disruption leads others.

For example:

Environmental feedback loop: Deforestation â†’ reduced land absorption â†’ more
surface runoff â†’ higher flood intensity.
