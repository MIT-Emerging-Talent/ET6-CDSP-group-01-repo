# 🕵🏼‍♂️The process of forming and understanding the problem

After research and discussions, we found out that many of the climate
issues are interconnected and could be considered as parts of a whole when you
try to study any of the problems, e.g. Climate change, Ecosystem changes,
Extreme weather events, Predictive modelling, and Data and AI impact.
By using systems thinking we understood that we can’t look at any of the issues
in isolation.

## 🔄 System Thinking

**Urbanization** is not a standalone process but part of a dynamic system with
far-reaching impacts. As cities expand, natural landscapes that once absorbed
rainfall—such as wetlands, forests, and open soil—are replaced with impermeable
surfaces like concrete and asphalt. This reduces the land’s ability to absorb
water, increases surface runoff, and overwhelms drainage systems, making urban
areas more vulnerable to flooding. These floods, intensified by climate change,
can damage homes, disrupt transportation, and interrupt food production. The
loss of crops and livestock contributes to food insecurity, which raises
prices, deepens poverty, and strains health systems. Rapid and unplanned urban
growth also leads to overcrowded settlements with inadequate infrastructure,
poor sanitation, and increased risk of disease outbreaks. These interlinked
challenges form negative feedback loops, where one issue triggers and amplifies
others, creating a cycle of vulnerability within urban environments.

For example:

Environmental feedback loop: Deforestation → reduced land absorption → more
surface runoff → higher flood intensity.
